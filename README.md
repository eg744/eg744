- 👋 Hi, I’m Elijah,
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development, and gaining a deeper understanding of software development in general! I love computers and I'm an avid learner.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on front-end web development, design and am curious about back-end web development. Web art is fun. I love animals and recently created a site with Next.js and Petfinder's API to help adopt animals in need. (Currently http://adopt-a-pet-bice.vercel.app/)
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in projects concerning websites and web apps.
