- 👋 Hi, I’m Elijah,
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development, and learning programming in general!
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front and back-end web development. Web art and design is fun. I love animals and I'm making a site to help people adopt those in need! (Currently http://adopt-a-pet-bice.vercel.app/)
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in projects concerning websites and web apps.
